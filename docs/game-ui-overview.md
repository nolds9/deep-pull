# ðŸŽ® **NFL Player Racing Game UI**

````
Create a modern, responsive React app for an NFL Player Racing Game. This is a Wikipedia-style racing game where users try to connect one NFL player to another using the shortest path through their connections.

## Game Concept
- Start with a random skill position player (QB, RB, WR, TE)
- End with another random skill position player
- Players are connected through: teammates, college, draft class, position
- Two Game Modes:
  - Solo: Find the shortest connection path between start and end players
  - Multiplayer: Race against the clock and a random opponent to be the first to create a succesful path to connect the start and end players.

## Core UI Components Needed

### 1. Game Header
- Game title "Player Rush"
- Current difficulty level indicator
- Timer

### 2. Player Cards
- Start player card (left side) - shows current player
- Target player card (right side) - shows goal player
- Each card should display:
  - Player name (large, bold)
  - Position badge (QB/RB/WR/TE with position-specific colors)
  - Team logo/abbreviation
  - Years active (e.g. "2020-2024")
  - Player Photo (Stretch goal)

### 3. Connection Search Interface
- Search bar with autocomplete for player names
- Search results showing matching players

### 4. Path Display
- Breadcrumb-style path showing: Player A â†’ Player B â†’ etc.
- End game, path shows connection type.

### 5. Game Controls
- "New Game" button
- "Give Up" button (shows solution)
- "Hint" button (reveals one connection)
- Difficulty selector (Easy/Medium/Hard based on degrees of separation)

## Visual Design
- Modern, clean interface with NFL-inspired colors
- Card-based layout with subtle shadows
- Position badges with distinct colors:
  - QB: Blue
  - RB: Green
  - WR: Orange
  - TE: Purple
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Smooth animations for state transitions

## Sample Data Structure
```javascript
const players = [
  {
    id: "MAH401939",
    name: "Patrick Mahomes",
    position: "QB",
    teams: ["KC"],
    college: "Texas Tech",
    firstSeason: 2017,
    lastSeason: 2024
  }
];

const connections = [
  {
    player1: "MAH401939",
    player2: "KEL123456",
    type: "teammate",
    metadata: { team: "KC", season: 2023 }
  }
];
````

## Key Interactions

1. Game starts with random start/end players
2. User searches for intermediate players
3. Clicking a player adds them to the current path
4. Game validates connections and provides feedback
5. Success state when path is complete
6. Option to share results or start new game

## Success States

- Show celebration animation when path is found
- Display path statistics (steps taken, time elapsed)
- Option to challenge friends with same player pair
- Leaderboard for shortest paths found

Please create a polished, interactive React component with mock data that demonstrates all these features. Include TypeScript types, modern CSS styling, and smooth user interactions. Focus on making it feel like a premium web game that NFL fans would enjoy playing.
