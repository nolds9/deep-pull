# üèõÔ∏è **NFL Gladiator Arena - Complete Game Prompt**

A fully interactive NFL Gladiator Arena game - a Roman-themed battle experience where players use NFL knowledge to compete in epic gladiator combat. This should be a complete, polished React application with TypeScript.

## üéÆ **Core Game Concept**

Transform the concept of connecting NFL players into an epic gladiator battle arena:

- Players become "Gladiators" fighting in Roman arenas
- NFL player connections become "Battle Moves" and "Combat Strikes"
- Racing becomes "Arena Combat" with health, combos, and crowd favor
- Rooms become "Arenas" with gladiator registration and war councils

## ‚öîÔ∏è **Game Mechanics**

### **Gladiator Combat System**

- **Health System**: Start with 100 health, decreases over time (0.5 per second)
- **Combo System**: Consecutive moves build combo multipliers (1x, 2x, 3x, etc.)
- **Crowd Favor**: Audience approval meter (0-100) that increases with good moves
- **Battle Cries**: Dynamic messages appear on successful moves ("VICTORY OR DEATH!", "CRUSHING BLOW!")
- **Health Recovery**: Successful moves restore health based on combo multiplier

### **Battle Progression**

- Start with random NFL skill position player (QB, RB, WR, TE)
- Target another random skill position player
- Execute "Battle Moves" through NFL connections:
  - **‚öîÔ∏è Battle Brothers** (Teammates)
  - **üõ°Ô∏è Legion Strike** (College connections)
  - **üèõÔ∏è Cohort Attack** (Draft class)
  - **‚ö° Formation Strike** (Same position)
